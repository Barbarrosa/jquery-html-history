{"name":"jQuery HTML history","tagline":"jQuery plugin for history management","body":"jQuery HTML5 History Plugin\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nPlugin that provides an \"htmlhistory\" event on the window object, notifying an application when the URL changes.  \r\nThis is accomplished by watching the hash, using the hashchange event from HTML5 or a polling interval in older browsers.  \r\nIn addition, in some modern browsers, HTML5 History Management is used to support changing the URL's path without reloading the page.  \r\nThis plugin also provides a method to navigate to a URL safely, that will use HTML5 History Management to avoid a page load.\r\nEverything degrades gracefully, and supports RESTful client development.\r\n\r\nBrowser Support:\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n    Chrome  - Any recent version of Chrome supports everything.\r\n    Safari  - Any recent version of Safari supports everything.\r\n    Firefox - Newer versions of Firefox support the hashchange event\r\n              Firefox 4 betas also support HTML5 History Management\r\n    Internet Explorer - IE8 supports hashchange\r\n              IE6 and 7 receive inferior hashchange support through a polling interval.\r\n    Others  - Other modern browsers probably support some subset of features.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse:\r\n----\r\n\r\ninclude jquery  \r\ninclude the request-interval.js  \r\ninclude the modernizr.min.js  \r\ninclude the jquery-html-history.min.js  \r\n\r\nonload call:\r\n\r\n    $(function() {\r\n        // initialize the plugin\r\n        $.htmlhistory.init({\r\n            useHistory: true,\r\n            useHashchange: true,\r\n            poll: 250,\r\n            interceptLinks: true,\r\n            disableHashLinks: true,\r\n            triggerOnLoad: true,\r\n            hash: '#!'\r\n        });\r\n        // bind the 'htmlhistory' event to the window\r\n        $(window).bind('htmlhistory', onURL);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    function onURL() {\r\n        var path = $.htmlhistory.url();\r\n        // respond to the url however you would like\r\n        console.log('respond to url', path);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n--------\r\n\r\n    options: {\r\n        useHistory: true, // whether we use HTML5 History Management to change the current path\r\n        useHashchange: true, // whether we use HTML5 Hashchange to listen to the URL hash\r\n        poll: 250, // when using Hashchange in browsers without it, how often to poll the hash (in ms)\r\n        interceptLinks: true, // do we intercept all relative links to avoid some page reloads?\r\n        disableHashLinks: true, // do we ensure all links with href=# are not followed (this would mess with our history)?\r\n        triggerOnLoad: true, // send the hash event on load\r\n        hash: '#!' // the hash to add if using hashes\r\n    },\r\n\r\n\r\nThis script must be used on a server for testing, local or otherwise.  I need to figure out a way to make it work from the file system.\r\n\r\nLicense:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis plugin was originally authored by Ben Cherry (bcherry@gmail.com), and is released under an MIT License (do what you want with it).  \r\nModifications made by Caleb Brown (twitter.com/kayluhb)  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
